              <p>
                In Nepal, governance has been a battleground for representation, transparency, and human rights. Over the years, historical power imbalances and political systems that have excluded marginalized groups have shaped governance models that are not always inclusive or transparent.
              </p>
              <p>
                For Gen Z, governance is not just about leading ‚Äî it's about creating systems of decision-making that are inclusive, fair, and empowering for everyone. Millennials, with their experience in managing organizations and navigating complex political landscapes, can guide Gen Z in setting up systems that promote rights, freedom, and equality.
              </p>
              <p>
                This page explores how Gen Z can revolutionize governance by adopting inclusive leadership practices, ensuring transparent decision-making, and creating policies that protect rights while ensuring accountability at every level.

              Governance is the backbone of social change ‚Äî without inclusive leadership, transparent processes, and robust policy frameworks, movements falter. Gen Z is ready to lead, but they need Millennials as guides, mentors, and advisors to build governance structures that are just, transparent, and inclusive. Together, we can lay the foundation for a new Nepal ‚Äî where leadership is equitable, rights are protected, and freedom is guaranteed for all.
