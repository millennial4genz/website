                The world is changing rapidly, with new technologies emerging every day that have the potential to transform society and empower young leaders. Frontier technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), IoT, and digital tools are already reshaping industries, improving governance, and tackling some of the world's most pressing challenges.
              </p>
              <p>
                For Gen Z in Nepal, these technologies are not just about innovation; they represent a new way of thinking â€” a digital-first approach to problem-solving that can bring about greater transparency, efficiency, and social impact. By leveraging frontier technologies, Gen Z can lead Nepal into a future where governance is decentralized, businesses are socially responsible, and resources are distributed fairly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Millennials can support Gen Z by providing mentorship in these areas, helping them navigate the complexities of new technologies, ensuring accessibility, and guiding their use in real-world applications.

              Frontier technologies like blockchain and AI hold the potential to radically transform Nepal's future, allowing Gen Z to lead the way in creating efficient, transparent, and equitable systems. Millennials can act as guides in empowering Gen Z to harness these technologies, ensuring they are used for social good, accessibility, and transparency, rather than reinforcing existing inequalities. Together, we can build a future where technology is both innovative and inclusive.
