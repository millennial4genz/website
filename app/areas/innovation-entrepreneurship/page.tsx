                Nepal's young population has long been an engine of creativity, yet many young innovators face significant challenges in accessing capital, networks, and opportunities. Despite limited resources, Gen Z in Nepal is tech-savvy, entrepreneurial, and visionary. The digital economy and social entrepreneurship have opened up new frontiers for them to create solutions that directly address local and global issues.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, access to capital remains one of the most significant barriers to youth-led innovation. Millennials can step in to bridge the gap, ensuring that Gen Z can access the tools, networks, and resources necessary to transform their ideas into sustainable ventures.
              </p>
              <p>
                This page explores how we can support Gen Z entrepreneurs in building innovative, impact-driven businesses while making sure that funding and resources are equitable and accessible.
